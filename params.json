{"name":"fancyplaceholder","tagline":"","body":"# fancyplaceholder: a jQuery plugin\r\n\r\nfancyplaceholder allows text box placeholders to be retained after there is text in the field. This is done by dropping the placeholder into a label below the field.\r\n\r\n## Usage\r\n\r\nApply fancyplaceholder to the fields that you want it active on.\r\n\r\nThis will apply it to all the fields on a page that have a placeholder:\r\n\r\n<pre>\r\n  $(':input[placeholder]').fancyplaceholder();\r\n</pre>\r\n\r\nIf you want to retain the labels even after the field loses focus call it like this:\r\n\r\n<pre>\r\n  $(':input[placeholder]').fancyplaceholder({keepLabels:true});\r\n</pre>\r\n\r\nYou can also customize the built in CSS to change the look of the placeholder label.\r\n\r\n## Browser support\r\nNatively placeholders are only supported in Firefox 4+, Chrome 2+, Safari 3+, and IE 10+. To use placeholders in older browsers you must use a plugin to enable the legacy support.\r\n\r\nThere are many of these, we recommend: https://github.com/mathiasbynens/jquery-placeholder\r\n\r\nYou can chain the two plugins together to use both:\r\n<pre>\r\n$(':input[placeholder]').placeholder().fancyplaceholder();\r\n</pre>\r\n\r\n## Licensing\r\n\r\nLicensed under the MIT license:\r\nhttp://www.opensource.org/licenses/mit-license.php\r\n\r\nCopyright (c) 2013 Aaron Cosentino","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
